Written in unity3d using kronnect's world political map assets.
Game design and additional code written by Kenneth Robertson.

Done: 
Basic ability to create a mesh and move the mesh anywhere within its specified radius.
Added functionality to allow player to move cities around during play.
Finally figured out how to draw a circle on a sphere.

Issues:
There is some flickering with the line of movement when its moving around alot.  This can be fixed using other drawing techniques but I will have to deal with the spherical geometry.

Todo:
I would like to enable the turn based aspect of the simulation, even with only one player this would go along way toward showing the potential of this design.
Despite kronnect not having any way to directly change the political map during game play my experiments with moving and deleting cities lead me to beleave that this can be accomplished using the existing code.
